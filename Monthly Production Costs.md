## Notes
- **Scaling**: Costs spike during production (e.g., $3.1M in one month for top-tier), so monthly averages smooth this out. Real timelines might extend (e.g., 12 months for $5M), lowering monthly costs but increasing total duration.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust based on your film’s needs (e.g., VFX-heavy vs. dialogue-driven).
- **Hidden Costs**: Insurance, contingencies (10% recommended), and marketing aren’t included but scale with budget (e.g., $50K for $500K tier, $500K+ for $5M).
