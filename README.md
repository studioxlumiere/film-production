## AI Prompts

### Character Development

- **Prompt**:
```
Develop a character named **Kael Draven**, a weathered desert wanderer in his late 40s, for a film shot in the style of Ultra Panavision 70, set against the endless dunes of a sun-scorched wasteland at twilight. Kael is a reluctant hero, once a revered tribal leader who lost everythingâ€”family, honor, and faithâ€”to a rival clanâ€™s betrayal a decade ago. Now, he roams as a scavenger, his wiry frame cloaked in tattered robes, a sun-bleached leather satchel slung across his chest, hiding a rusted dagger etched with his old clanâ€™s sigil. His face is a map of survival: sharp cheekbones framed by a salt-and-pepper beard, eyes like storm cloudsâ€”piercing yet hauntedâ€”scarred by a jagged line across his left brow from a fight he barely won. Kaelâ€™s voice is low and gravelly, each word measured, carrying the weight of unspoken grief, but it cracks with dry wit when heâ€™s pushed. He moves with a predatorâ€™s grace, deliberate and silent, yet his hands tremble faintly when he grips the daggerâ€”a tell of buried rage and guilt. His arc is redemption through sacrifice: heâ€™s drawn into a brewing war between clans over a hidden oasis, forced to lead again despite his distrust of others, ultimately giving his life to secure peace heâ€™ll never see. For casting, seek an actor who can embody quiet intensity and physicalityâ€”think a lean, rugged type with a voice that resonates like distant thunder, capable of conveying both stoic resolve and raw vulnerability. Bonus if theyâ€™ve got experience with subtle, expressive silences that fill a widescreen frame.
```
### Character Model Sheet
- **Prompt**:
```
"Create a character model sheet featuring a generic young adventurer, male, with short brown hair, wearing a leather jacket, pants, and boots, holding a sword. Full body view, multiple poses (front, side, back, 3/4 view) in a turnaround style, white background, highly detailed, masterpiece quality, epic composition, photorealistic style like a real photo in RAW format, best quality rendering, sharp edges, cinematic lighting."
```
### Acting
- **Prompt**:
```
Prepare for a pivotal scene in **The Shattered Basin**, a vast desert canyon, shot in Ultra Panavision 70 with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio, set at twilight with a golden-orange sky fading to purple. This is a quiet, tense moment of transition for **Kael Draven**, a weathered wanderer, as he faces the distant rumble of approaching ridersâ€”his past catching up. The scene plays out in five beats, and your performances should evoke the raw, analog grandeur of 1960s epics like *Lawrence of Arabia*â€”subtle yet commanding, filling the wide frame with presence. Hereâ€™s how to approach it:

### For Kael Dravenâ€™s Actor:
- **Context**: Youâ€™re Kael, a once-proud leader broken by betrayal, now a scavenger surviving on instinct. Youâ€™ve just pried open a weathered crateâ€”bronze coins and a cracked jug insideâ€”when you hear hoofbeats. This isnâ€™t just a threat; itâ€™s a ghost of your old life stirring dread and defiance.
- **Methodology**: Use a **Stanislavski-inspired approach**â€”dig into Kaelâ€™s emotional memory. Before the scene, recall a personal moment of loss or betrayal to fuel your quiet grief; let it simmer under a stoic mask. Physically, embody his weariness: your wiry frame moves with a predatorâ€™s grace but sags slightlyâ€”years in the desert weigh on you. Your hands tremble faintly when gripping the rusted dagger; itâ€™s muscle memory of violence you hate revisiting.
- **Beats**:
  1. **Crouched by the Crate (Wide Shot)**: Youâ€™re still, head bowed, inspecting the loot. Your breathingâ€™s slow, deliberateâ€”savor the silence of solitude. The wide frame dwarfs you; let your smallness feel deliberate, a man carved down by time.
  2. **Hearing the Rumble (Medium Shot)**: A faint hoofbeat hitsâ€”freeze mid-motion, dagger resting on your knee. Tilt your head slightly, listening, as if the soundâ€™s a knife in your gut. Your storm-cloud eyes flicker with recognition; donâ€™t overplay itâ€”keep it internal.
  3. **Trembling Grip (Close Shot)**: Shift focus to your hand on the daggerâ€”let it shake subtly, a crack in your armor. Your face hardens, jaw tight, but your gaze softens with buried pain. Whisper â€˜Not againâ€™â€”gravelly, low, like itâ€™s torn from your throat. The cameraâ€™s tight; every micro-expression counts.
  4. **Rising (Over-the-Shoulder)**: Stand slowly, deliberately, hood shadowing your face. Your posture shiftsâ€”less scavenger, more warriorâ€”but itâ€™s reluctant. Glance toward the dust cloud; let dread and resolve wrestle in your stance. The horizonâ€™s wideâ€”own it with quiet intensity.
  5. **Scanning (Tracking Shot)**: Turn in a slow arc, dagger loose in hand, as the camera dollies. Your eyes sweep the dunesâ€”searching, calculating. Sand stings your face; flinch subtly, pull the hood tighter. End facing the riders, a lone figure rooted but ready to break. Your silence screams louder than words.

### For the Ridersâ€™ Ensemble (3-5 Actors):
- **Context**: Youâ€™re a scouting party from a rival clan, hardened desert raiders tracking Kaelâ€”maybe for revenge, maybe for the oasis rumor he carries. Youâ€™re distant figures in this scene, but your presence looms.
- **Methodology**: Lean into **ensemble physicality**â€”think Meisner technique. React as a unit: your horsesâ€™ restless stomps and your curt, barked signals (grunts, whistles) build a collective threat. Youâ€™re not individuals yetâ€”just a force. Stay loose but coiled, reins tight, bodies leaning forwardâ€”hungry for the chase.
- **Beats**: Youâ€™re only in the final two shots:
  4. **Dust Cloud (Over-the-Shoulder)**: Appear as silhouettes in a swelling dust plume, far right of the frame. Keep your movements sharpâ€”horses toss heads, you adjust grips on reins or spears. No faces yet; youâ€™re a mythic menace in Kaelâ€™s eyes.
  5. **Approach (Tracking Shot)**: As Kael turns, you grow slightly clearerâ€”still distant, but your pace quickens. One of you lets out a low, guttural call (improvise a wordless shout). Lean into the wind, cloaks billowingâ€”your energy fills the frameâ€™s right edge, pushing Kaelâ€™s stillness to its limit.

### General Notes:
- **Tone**: This is quiet tension, not bombastâ€”think slow burn over explosion. The Ultra Panavision frame loves stillness and space; let your performances breathe, trusting the wide lens to amplify every glance or shift.
- **Physicality**: Kael, your props (dagger, satchel, hood) are extensions of youâ€”use them naturally. Riders, your horses and gear are your voiceâ€”make them restless, alive.
- **Efficiency**: Weâ€™re on a tight desert shootâ€”rehearse these beats off-set to nail it in minimal takes. Kael, your close-upâ€™s the heart; riders, your silhouetteâ€™s the hookâ€”precision saves us time and budget.

**Inspiration**: Kael, channel Peter Oâ€™Tooleâ€™s restrained fury in *Lawrence* or Clint Eastwoodâ€™s haunted grit in *Unforgiven*. Riders, think the faceless menace of *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*â€™s bounty hunters. Letâ€™s make this frame sing with soul and scale.
```
### Concept Art
- **Prompt**:
```
"Create a cinematic concept art book for 'The Shattered Basin,' a sprawling desert epic. Depict a vast, arid world with cracked earth, towering sand dunes, and ancient ruins under a fiery orange sky. Include key elements: a rugged warrior leader (male, scarred, tattered robes, staff), a mysterious hooded oracle (female, flowing veils, glowing orb), a band of nomads on camel-like beasts, a monolithic obsidian fortress,
```
### Scene / Location
- **Prompt**:
```
Set the scene in **The Shattered Basin**, a sprawling desert canyon carved into the earth like a jagged wound, filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio. Itâ€™s twilight, the sky a bruised tapestry of orange and violet, casting long, sharp shadows across dunes that ripple out to a distant, crumbling mesa. The air hums with the faint whine of wind through eroded rock spiresâ€”twisted natural sculptures, 20 feet tall, bleached bone-white by centuries of sun. In the foreground, a shallow, cracked salt flat reflects the fading light, its edges littered with sun-scorched scrub brush and the skeletal remains of a long-dead camel, half-buried in sand. Center stage is **Kael Draven**, crouched beside a **prop: weathered wooden crate**, its splintered lid pried open to reveal a stash of tarnished bronze coins and a cracked clay water jugâ€”remnants of a caravan heâ€™s scavenged. His **prop: rusted dagger** rests on his knee, its etched sigil catching the last rays of sun, while his **prop: tattered leather satchel** lies open beside him, spilling a few dry dates and a frayed map scribbled with faded ink. The scene: Kael hears a distant rumbleâ€”hoofbeatsâ€”and rises slowly, his shadow stretching across the salt flat like a dark omen. He grips the dagger, hands trembling faintly, and mutters, 'Not again,' his gravelly voice breaking the silence as he scans the horizon. A gust kicks up sand, stinging his scarred face, and he pulls his **prop: threadbare hood** tighter, squinting toward a dust cloud swelling in the distanceâ€”riders approaching. The camera pans wide, capturing the vastness of the Basin, then dollies in on Kaelâ€™s storm-cloud eyes, flickering with dread and defiance. For props, keep them minimal but tactile: the crateâ€™s rough grain, the daggerâ€™s pitted metal, the mapâ€™s brittle edgesâ€”all weathered like Kael himself, grounding the epic frame in gritty realism.
```
### Storyboard
- **Prompt**:
```
Create a storyboard for a tense, cinematic scene in **The Shattered Basin**, a vast desert canyon, shot in Ultra Panavision 70 with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio. The mood is gritty and timeless, evoking 1960s 70mm epicsâ€”think wide, sweeping frames with sharp foregrounds and deep, textured horizons. Set it at twilight, the sky a mix of orange and purple, casting long shadows across dunes, rock spires, and a cracked salt flat. Focus on **Kael Draven**, a weathered wanderer, in a pivotal moment of quiet before conflict. Use the following shot breakdown:

1. **Wide Shot (Establishing)** - Frame the full scope of the Basin: dunes stretch left to right, filling the 2.76:1 frame, with twisted, bone-white rock spires dotting the midground and a crumbling mesa on the distant horizon. Kael is a small, lone figure center-frame, crouched beside a weathered wooden crate on the salt flat, his shadow stretching long and dark. Subtle anamorphic lens flare glints off the horizon from the fading sun, camera static to emphasize scale.

2. **Medium Shot (Kaelâ€™s Discovery)** - Cut closer: Kaelâ€™s wiry frame fills the left third of the frame, hunched over the crate, its splintered lid open. His tattered leather satchel spills dates and a frayed map beside him. His rusted dagger rests on his knee, sigil catching a golden gleam. The salt flat reflects twilight hues behind him, with spires looming soft-focus in the background. Camera tilts slightly up, capturing his scarred faceâ€”sharp cheekbones, haunted eyesâ€”under his threadbare hood.

3. **Close Shot (Reaction)** - Tight on Kaelâ€™s face: his storm-cloud eyes widen faintly, brow furrowing as he hears a distant rumble (hoofbeats). Sand dusts his salt-and-pepper beard. His left hand trembles as it grips the daggerâ€”focus on the subtle shake. Background blurs into a warm bokeh of dunes and sky, keeping the wide frameâ€™s depth. Camera holds steady, letting his expression carry the beat.

4. **Over-the-Shoulder Shot (Threat Emerges)** - From behind Kael, looking past his hooded head toward the horizon: a dust cloud swells in the distance, tiny rider silhouettes barely visible, filling the right half of the frame. The salt flat and spires frame him on the left, grounding his isolation. Camera starts low, then rises slightly as he stands, his shadow shiftingâ€”anamorphic edges curving subtly.

5. **Wide Tracking Shot (Stand and Scan)** - Kael rises fully, dagger in hand, and turns slowly, scanning the horizon. The camera dollies right in a smooth arc, keeping him center-frame as the Basinâ€™s vastness unfolds: dunes, spires, and mesa sweep past in the 2.76:1 width. His muttered line, 'Not again,' hangs in the air. Sand kicks up from a gust, streaking across the foreground. End with him facing the dust cloud, a lone figure dwarfed by the epic landscape.

**Notes for Artist**: Use bold contrastsâ€”golden light vs. deep shadowsâ€”to mimic 70mm film stock. Keep props (crate, dagger, satchel) detailed in close-ups for texture. Emphasize Kaelâ€™s silhouette and the frameâ€™s width in widesâ€”think *Lawrence of Arabia* scope. Add faint grain and soft lens flares for that analog Ultra Panavision feel. Keep motion deliberate, no quick cuts, to build tension organically.
```
### Mood Board
- **Prompt**:
```
Design a mood board for a film scene set in **The Shattered Basin**, a desolate desert canyon, shot in Ultra Panavision 70 with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio, evoking the raw, epic spirit of 1960s 70mm classics like *Lawrence of Arabia*. Center it on **Kael Draven**, a weathered wanderer, in a tense twilight moment as he faces an approaching threat. The board should fuse producer practicality, creative direction, and stylistic flair to define the filmâ€™s visual identity.

- **Color Palette**: Anchor in twilight huesâ€”deep oranges and golds bleeding into bruised purples and cool grays. Accent with the sun-bleached whites of sand and rock, punctuated by shadowy charcoals in Kaelâ€™s silhouette and the distant mesa. Add subtle anamorphic flares: soft blue streaks glinting off metal or horizon edges.

- **Textures**: Rough and tactileâ€”cracked salt flats with a dusty sheen, wind-eroded rock spires like gnarled bone, and dunes rippling in soft, organic waves. Layer in Kaelâ€™s world: splintered wood grain on the weathered crate, pitted rust on his dagger, and the brittle, frayed edges of his map. Aim for a 70mm film stock vibeâ€”slight grain, no digital polish.

- **Wardrobe (Kaelâ€™s Style)**: Kaelâ€™s look is survivalist-chicâ€”tattered robes in faded earth tones (sand beige, muted olive), patched with coarse stitching. His threadbare hood, a sun-faded rust red, drapes loose, shadowing his scarred face. The leather satchel, cracked and worn, slings across his chest, its straps fraying. Boots are scuffed, ankle-high, with sand caked into the solesâ€”functional, not flashy. Every piece feels lived-in, weathered by years in the Basin.

- **Props**: Minimal but storytellingâ€”place the rusted dagger with its etched sigil front and center, its blade dulled by time. The wooden crate, half-broken, spills tarnished bronze coins and a cracked clay jug. The leather satchel holds dry dates and a crumpled, ink-faded mapâ€”props that hint at Kaelâ€™s past and present. Scatter camel bones in the sand, bleached white, for eerie texture.

- **Atmosphere**: Capture the vastness of the Ultra Panavision frameâ€”Kaelâ€™s lone figure dwarfed by dunes and spires, with long shadows stretching across the salt flat. Infuse a sense of quiet dread: a faint dust cloud on the horizon, wind-streaked sand swirling in the foreground, and a golden glow fading into dusk. Add a retro filmic touchâ€”soft lens flares, warm highlights, and a hint of grainy haze.

- **Inspiration**: Pull from *Lawrence of Arabia*â€™s sweeping desert vistas, *The Revenant*â€™s gritty survivalism, and *Dune* (2021)â€™s tactile costumesâ€”blend into a unique, analog epic. Think Kael as a rugged Peter Oâ€™Toole meets a lean Hugh Glass.

**Notes**: Keep it practical for productionâ€”wardrobe and props should be sourceable (vintage fabrics, aged metal) yet bold enough for marketing posters. The mood is stoic yet majestic, balancing Kaelâ€™s personal stakes with the Basinâ€™s grandeur. Arrange the board with wide landscape shots at the top, Kaelâ€™s close-up textures center, and prop details belowâ€”let the 2.76:1 frame breathe across it all.
```
## Production
### Camera: Ultra Panavision 70
- **Prompt**:
```
Shoot a cinematic scene in Ultra Panavision 70 (2.76:1 aspect ratio). Capture a vast landscapeâ€”endless desert dunes at golden sunset, towering mountains, or a battlefieldâ€”with anamorphic lens effects curving the edges. Use natural, dramatic lighting (deep shadows, vibrant highlights) and 70mm film texture (slight grain, rich colors, soft glow). Emphasize depth: sharp foreground (e.g., lone figure, chariot, ruins) against a crisp horizon. Mood is epic, timeless, with slow pans or dolly shots for scale. Aim for a 1960s Hollywood analog feel, no digital sheen
```

### Lighting: Ultra Panavision 70
- **Prompt**:
```
Light a desert scene at magic hour in Ultra Panavision 70 (2.76:1). Use a low-angle 1k HMI with 1/2 CTO gel for a golden key on a horseback figure, camera-left, with a 4x4 bounce for subtle fill. Background dunes lit by natural orange/purple sky, enhanced with a 12k HMI (1/4 CTS gel) skimming low from camera-right, plus a 2k fresnel backlight for rimming. Add flicker, minimal diffusion, and 1/4 fog for organic 70mm clarity and anamorphic flare. Shadows are long, tones warm/cool, evoking raw grandeur.
```

### Audio: Ultra Panavision 70
- **Prompt**:
```
Record a mountain valley scene in Ultra Panavision 70 (2.76:1) at twilightâ€”an outlaw on rocky terrain, storm brewing. Use a hypercardioid shotgun mic (e.g., Sennheiser MKH 70) on a boom for dialogue/breaths, paired with a lav mic (e.g., Sanken COS-11D) and Sound Devices 633. Capture ambiance with a stereo pair (e.g., Schoeps CMC 6) for echo/thunder. In post, layer foley (boot scrapes, gear rattles) and wind rumble (field recordings or Moog synth) in 5.1 for an immersive, 1960s 70mm feel.
```
