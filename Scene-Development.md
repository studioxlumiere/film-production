# Scene Foundation System for Prompt Creation

## 1. Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Primary Styles:**  
  - Neon rim lights (outlining the subject)  
  - Backlighting (creating silhouettes and depth)  
  - Cinematic lighting (balanced highlights and shadows)  
  - Dramatic low-key lighting (moody, high contrast)  
  - Side lighting (sculpting form with contrast)  
  - Luminous glow (emphasizing light reflections and diffusion)  
  - Soft natural lighting (daylight, golden hour, moonlight)  
  - Harsh lighting (noir-style shadows, intense contrast)  

- **Light Sources & Effects:**  
  - Neon signs (dynamic, atmospheric light sources)  
  - LED strobes (color bursts, nightclub vibes)  
  - Fog with light diffusion (soft ambient glow)  
  - Reflective surfaces enhancing neon effects (glass, wet streets, metallic surfaces)  
  - Candlelight (warm, flickering, intimate setting)  
  - Firelight (campfires, torches, explosions for dramatic effect)  
  - Flashlights (detective, horror, or suspense settings)  

- **Mood & Environment:**  
  - Cyberpunk cityscape (dark urban jungle, dense neon ambiance)  
  - Futuristic industrial (metallic, mechanical, dystopian aesthetic)  
  - Abstract luminous space (dreamlike, surreal sci-fi settings)  
  - High-energy club scenes (intense, vibrant lighting)  
  - Natural landscapes (mountains, forests, deserts, oceans)  
  - Historical settings (medieval castles, Victorian mansions, ancient ruins)  
  - Post-apocalyptic (ruined cities, wastelands, overgrown urban decay)  
  - Sci-fi interiors (spaceships, laboratories, high-tech buildings)

## 2. Camera & Lens Setup
- **Lenses & Perspective:**  
  - **14mm Lens:** Wide, dramatic perspective, exaggerated depth.  
  - **24mm Lens:** Balanced close-ups, natural proportions.  
  - **Anamorphic Lens:** Cinematic widescreen look, lens flares, and artistic distortion.  
  - **50mm Lens:** Classic portrait and cinematic standard.  
  - **85mm Lens:** Beautiful bokeh and depth, perfect for character-focused shots.  
  - **Macro Lens:** Extreme close-ups for intricate textures and details.  
  - **Telephoto Lens:** Isolating subjects in crowded environments.  

- **Camera Details:**  
  - Shot on **Canon EOS R5** (professional-grade clarity and dynamic range)  
  - Shallow depth of field (sharp subject, blurred background)  
  - Motion blur (adds movement, speed, or action)  
  - Bokeh effects (out-of-focus neon lights creating soft glowing orbs)  
  - Chromatic aberration (color fringing for sci-fi or cyberpunk aesthetics)  
  - Handheld vs. Stabilized (documentary realism vs. smooth cinematic tracking)  
  - Drone shots (epic aerial views, establishing shots)

## 3. Artistic & Epic Aesthetics
- **Quality & Detail Level:**  
  - **Ultra-high resolution:** 8K, 4K, RAW format  
  - **Octane Render:** Realistic light behavior, high-fidelity textures  
  - **Meticulous Detail:** Every pore, fabric fold, droplet, and reflection finely rendered  
  - **Hyperrealism:** Perfect skin texture, true-to-life materials  
  - **Black & White Cinematic:** High-contrast, dramatic grayscale tones  
  - **Vintage Film Look:** Grainy textures, faded colors, film reel imperfections  

- **Composition & Cinematic Depth:**  
  - Rule of thirds (balanced framing, natural eye movement)  
  - Golden ratio (harmonious proportions for an aesthetically pleasing composition)  
  - Dutch angle (slightly tilted frame for tension and dynamism)  
  - Leading lines (neon signs, urban structures guiding the viewer's eye)  
  - Negative space (emphasizing subject against a minimalist or vast background)  
  - Over-the-shoulder framing (immersive character perspectives)  
  - Long takes vs. Quick cuts (fluid storytelling vs. high-energy action)

## 4. Composition & Subject Framing
- **Shot Types:**  
  - **Full-body shot:** Subject dominates the scene with contextual elements  
  - **Mid-shot:** Focuses on upper body details and expressions  
  - **Extreme close-up:** Emphasizing intricate textures (lips, skin pores, reflections in eyes)  
  - **Over-the-shoulder:** Subject looking over a neon-lit cityscape  
  - **Low-angle heroic shot:** Power stance, dramatic presence  
  - **POV shot:** Immersive, first-person perspective  
  - **Birdâ€™s-eye view:** Overhead, god-like perspective of the scene  

- **Focus & Depth:**  
  - **Laser-sharp focus:** Ultra-precise details in skin, fabric, reflections  
  - **Tilt-shift effect:** Creating miniature-like depth in cityscapes  
  - **Depth mapping:** Layers of foreground, subject, and background for rich composition

- **Essential Props:**  
  - Weapons (guns, swords, futuristic laser weapons)  
  - Vehicles (cars, motorcycles, spaceships, horses)  
  - Technological gadgets (holograms, control panels, wearable tech)  
  - Books, papers, artifacts (historical or mystical elements)  
  - Food and drinks (setting mood, cultural immersion)  
  - Clothing and accessories (masks, gloves, helmets, jewelry)  

- **Set Elements:**  
  - Furniture (luxurious, minimalist, futuristic, antique)  
  - Wall textures (brick, steel, neon panels, holographic projections)  
  - Environmental details (trash, graffiti, plants, cables, debris)
